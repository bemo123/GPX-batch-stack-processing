# GPX-batch-stack-processing
 Several PYTHON scripts for batch processing of GPX files.

# Usage
I recommend using Anaconda Python IDE to execute the scripts. Create a new environment in Anaconda.Navigator and install the required libraries 
- scipy
- pandas
- pyproj

Then, install Spyder to your new environment using Anaconda.Navigator again. Launch Spyder and create a working directory. Download this repository with all its .py scripts into the working directory and add all GPX files that you want to manipulate.

Run the desired .py script by typing 

'''python
run xyz.py
'''
