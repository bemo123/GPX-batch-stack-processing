# GPX-batch-stack-processing
 Several python scripts for batch processing of GPX files.

#Usage
I recommend using Anaconda Python IDE to execute the scripts. Create a new environment in Anaconda.Navigator and install the required libraries 
- scipy
- pandas
- pyproj

Then, install Spyder to your new environment using Anaconda.Navigator again. Launch Spyder and create a working directory. Download the desired .py scripts into the directory
